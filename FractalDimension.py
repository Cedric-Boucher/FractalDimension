def fractal_dimension(image: np.ndarray) -> np.float64:
    """ Calculates the fractal dimension of an image represented by a 2D numpy array.

    The algorithm is a modified box-counting algorithm as described by Wen-Li Lee and Kai-Sheng Hsieh.

    Args:
        image: A 2D array containing a grayscale image. Format should be equivalent to cv2.imread(flags=0).
               The size of the image has no constraints, but it needs to be square (mÃ—m array).
    Returns:
        D: The fractal dimension Df, as estimated by the modified box-counting algorithm.
